  <h1>Web Development Reflection</h1>
  <p>
    The main aspect of web development that I learned about in this class was about grid properties as well as mobile first web development. The grid property is such a simple aspect of web development but it is also so pivotal in adding dynamics to your webpage while also keeping a consistent theme since by using grids I can structure my elements into a more manageable design that will allow me to visualize it more accurately and adapt it to any screen size that I need to.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other aspect of web development that had the most impact in how I design my websites is the mobile first approach to design. This especially changed how I go about designing my website and shifting the focus from removing aspects of the webpage as the page gets smaller to starting off what are the essential elements for the web page and adding on or scaling up as the screen size grows larger. This made it much easier for me to envision how I would put the page together since prior to knowing about mobile first design I would struggle to figure out what elements were less important that I could remove to fit the smaller screens since I felt as if all that I included in the original design were essential to the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also assisted me in improving at designing for mobile devices since to me it just felt foreign to me since most of the webpage I visit are on the PC viewport so I am used to the setup of that view rather than mobile.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aspects of the course I would want to investigate further is Bootstrap, especially if I want to practice the design aspect of web development more since Bootstrap will allow me to quickly make prototypes of websites to get the general idea of how I should layout the website elements. I also want to practice the use cases for responsive images since the idea behind loading an image based off a the viewport rather than loading a static image and resizing it based off the viewport never occurred to me, especially when it comes to larger websites where loading large images for every viewport becomes unrealistic in terms of bandwidth and speed of loading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideas that I would want to improve upon, like I said earlier, would be the design of my web pages including color, and layout optimization since I feel what I lack in my websites is knowing what elements actually fit well based on the theme of the page. For instance, for the final project I was able to envision a general idea of what I wanted the project to be like but it was hard for me to actually find the right sources and media to add to the page without it looking either too busy or too empty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing I want to improve on is the styling of each breakpoint in making them each cohesive with each other while also making them separate enough so that they actually seem like they belong with each viewport they are attributed to. Also with understanding, in a similar vein as to what I said before, what type of media to add for each viewport since I donâ€™t understand proper UI/UX design as well as not having enough experience designing these aspects myself to actually be confident in my design choices.
