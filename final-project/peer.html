      <h2>Age of the Website</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main pieces of feedback I got was that due to the dates being set in 2022 it makes the website seem outdated rather than just a website that is no longer in use. To address this I added a footer indicating the site is archived.

      <h2>Ticket Purchase</h2>
      <p>
        Another suggestion was to add a ticket buying page, since the site seemed to lack functionality. I added a simple ticket purchase page with options and a checkout button, which would work in a real deployment.

      <h2>Hover Animations</h2>
      <p>
        I added underline and color-change hover effects to the tour date links to make them more interactive and visually engaging, which I had overlooked at first.
